## Resolution Reduction Approach

### Main Idea
Take 2 squiggles with very high similarity, and manipulate one of them along time axis so that they look (almost) identical.

The motivation behind this approach is to try and eliminate the need for DTW by finding a method to reduce the resolution of raw (or normalised) squiggles in such a way that similar squiggles have similar reduced-resolution representations.

The notebooks give visual demonstrations of some resolution reduction methods, some methods to test similarity between reduced-resolution squiggles, and some results of comparisons of squiggles in a dataset with known high similarity of squiggles in the sequence space.
