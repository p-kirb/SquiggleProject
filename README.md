## Squiggle Project

### Main Idea
The overarching aim of the experiments is to find a method to produce a smaller representation of a squiggle such that the smaller representations of several squiggles can be compared and their similarities reflect the similarities of the squiggles in sequence space. The larger motivation for this is to have a fast lookup system that, when given raw squiggle data, can find the most similar squiggles from a given database.
